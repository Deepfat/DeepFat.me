Operating systems are able to execute JavaScript from a remote web server, web apps are able to reach into your documents and fiddle around with them, you can wrap your website with rich, native functionality. In this talk we'll look at the murky and confusing world of hosted hybrid web apps. We'll look at the different tools available for creating hosted hybrid apps on multiple platforms.

Machine Learning sits behind artificial intelligence and on the surface it may seem like a deeply technical, scientific topic. We are here to tell you that it is more accessible than you think. We’ll look at some of the basics around machine learning. We’ll also look some of the API services that make it very easy to implement artificial intelligence ‘smarts’ into your application with simple, standard REST calls",
