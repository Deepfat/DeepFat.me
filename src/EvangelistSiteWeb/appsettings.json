    "Bio": {
      "FirstPerson": "I have been working in Business Intelligence and analytics for the over twenty years. Most of this has been on the Microsoft platform especially the SQL Server ecosystem.  However for the last couple of years my focus has been big data and analytics on the Azure platform, including Machine Learning, and the various tools for managing and analysing big data.  I regularly present to community groups on the latest Microsoft cognitive technologies. I also host TechDays Online which regularly gets over ten thousand viewers watching the live stream.",
      "ThirdPerson": "Andrew joined Microsoft in 2007 as a technical evangelist, focusing on business intelligence and data development. Andrew’s role puts him in contact with all sizes of organisation from start-ups to UK Big business and government where he has a track record of making the complex simple and the future relevant now.  His particular passion is the appropriate application of data to solve real world problems and to do that as ethically as possible such that the technology itself becomes invisible.",
